Packages like `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `data.table`, `SparkR`, `ggplot2` have made data manipulation, visualization and computation much easier *and* faster.\n",

You'd have to relearn everything so you can reference it in whatever context you need it for. In R and any other programming language, the form of 'memory' we use to reference information (or data) is with *variables*. \n",

    "Variable are composed of two parts: its variable name, and its variable value. The variable name is how you reference whatever piece or collection of data you need. The are names we assign values to. Why do we want to do this? Because without variables, we don't have a way of referencing and using data. Value can be many things, including another variable, but in most cases, the value is a <b>data type</b>. \n",
