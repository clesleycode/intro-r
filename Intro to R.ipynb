    "\n",
    "R is a powerful language used primarily for data analysis and statistical computing. R has what we call `packages`, which can used for almost any data science task. Packages like `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `data.table`, `SparkR`, `ggplot2` have made data manipulation, visualization and computation much easier *and* faster.\n",

    "### Why use R?\n",

They're particularly useful when you're working on something complex and want to remember why or what you did, as well as for when other people need to read your code and don't have you to explain it to them. \n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you had no memory to store information you need on a regular basis. That would be miserable, right? You'd have to relearn everything so you can reference it in whatever context you need it for. In R and any other programming language, the form of 'memory' we use to reference information (or data) is with *variables*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variable are composed of two parts: its variable name, and its variable value. The variable name is how you reference whatever piece or collection of data you need. The are names we assign values to. Why do we want to do this? Because without variables, we don't have a way of referencing and using data. Value can be many things, including another variable, but in most cases, the value is a <b>data type</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "In R, there are actually <b>two</b> ways of assigning values: `=` and `<-`. Typically though, we use `<-`, such as `my_val <- 4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types and Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programming language needs to store data and a way to work with this data. R, like other languages, breaks these data into types and provides different ways to interact with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Everything you see or create in R is an <b>object</b>. A vector, matrix, data frame, even a variable is an object. R treats it that way. So, R has 5 basic classes of objects, including:\n",
